    <p>John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
    John 3:17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
    John 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.

    <p style="margin-top45px;">John 3:19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds will be exposed.
    John 3:20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed.
    John 3:21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.</p>
